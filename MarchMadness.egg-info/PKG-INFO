Progress Report (Week of 01/16/22)

Rylee Benes

I collaborated with my teammates to successfully organize a completed Final Project Proposal by filling in a few areas of the document related to success criteria and formatting the document to make it readable. I created the OSS diagram used in our Final Project Proposal. I made sure to stay updated with my teammates to confirm that our Proposal was the best it could be and that it would be turned in on time.

Luca Rivera

I successfully identified SMART Goals for the new proposal with my team. We expanded the original proposal in order for it to fit the new updated requirements. This past week was mostly meeting up with the group and researching more about our project in order to have a clearer idea on how to better our proposal. I also researched different technologies that we can possibly implement/use in our project.

I created the github repository and added Rylee and Luca as contributors. I then met with both of them and we came up with a guideline for the OSS diagram which Rylee converted from pen and paper to a digital image. We then added success criteria to our final proposal, using the SMART metrics. Finally, I researched data sources that we can use for our project.

Progress Report (Week of 01/23/22)

Rylee Benes

I worked with my team on Tuesday to complete the deliverable talking about repository architecture and our code review policy. I was able to find some code on GitHub that uses a Python GUI to make a nice-looking bracket visualization. Both Tuesday and Thursday, I was able to manipulate the code to produce a bracket we liked and create a mapping dictionary to keep track of all the x-y coordinates of each bracket box, so we can add team names later. I was able to create our first feature branch in our repository and push the code there.

I started the function for parsing the data, the next step is to add all of the teams in the tournament from a given year to a set, and the data will be organized nicely for each year. I also worked on the deliverables with Rylee and Luca this week during lab. We completed them during 
lab so we did not need to do any more work on them individually.

Luca Rivera

Worked with my team in the Word doc for Code review and how we were going to build our repository. I was not able to do hands on work this week because I was sick and could not attend a group meeting. I am now up to date with the progress of the team and will be contributing more with the programming aspects.
